Summary: Elegant theme shows Previous and Next article link to make navigation of the site easier
Keywords: 

The Previous and Next post links are a powerful way to keep visitors engaged
and to guide them through your site.

Elegant requires [Neighbor Articles
plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/neighbors) to
show these navigational links.

Elegant shows newer article on the right hand side and older article on the
left hand side at the bottom of every article.

Most of the content on web is written in left to right languages. In these
languages pages are placed from left to right. It seemed natural to use the
same order in Elegant.
