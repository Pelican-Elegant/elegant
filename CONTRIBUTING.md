# Where do I start?

Developing Elegant is a community effort, so you are very welcome to help develop it further into the most elegant theme out there.

The main repository of Elegant is on [GitHub][elegant], which you may fork and then submit pull requests to, in order for them to be merged.

If you found any issues, or have ideas how to improve the theme, please submit an [issue][].

Also see issues tagged as [Pull Request Welcome](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/pelican-elegant/labels/pull%20request%20welcome) – these are issues that are not directly on our roadmap, but if you have time to contribute, we would be very glad to review and accept your pull request.


# New Features and Styles

If you plan to add new features to the theme, please make sure that:

1. you set sensible defaults so the theme works out of the box, without forcing the user to set any variable
1. your changes do not negatively effect readability and reading experience
1. your changes do not cause distraction for the reader

# Code style

Please make sure to follow the code style of the existing codebase.

Specifically:

## Code/Template Formatting Rules

1. use single (`''`) rather than double (`""`) quotation marks for Jinja strings
1. in Jinja print statements, surround the variable with spaces inside curly braces – for example: `{{ foo.bar }}`
1. use double (`""`) quotation marks around HTML attributes
1. end files with a newline

## CSS Formatting Rules

1. font name's first letter should be capital
1. add a space after comma
1. declarations should be sorted alphabetically
1. use a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block
1. group together related classes and identities
1. add a space after colon
1. remove leading 0s
1. remove unit specification after 0 values
1. use three-digit Hex notation for colors whereever possible
1. use hyphen `-` instead of underscore `_` in class and identity names

Refer to [Google's HTML/CSS Style Guide][google_style_guide] for all other formatting rules.
