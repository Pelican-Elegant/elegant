See issues tagged with [Pull Request
Welcomed](https://github.com/talha131/pelican-elegant/issues?labels=Pull+Request+Welcomed).
I, @talha131, do not plan to work on these issues. You are more than welcome to
pick them up.

New Features and Styles
=======================

If you plan to add new features to the theme, please make sure

1. You set sensible defaults so that theme works out of the box, without
   forcing user to set any variable
2. Your feature should not effect readability and reading experience
3. It should not be distracting for the reader

Follow the code style of the existing codebase
==============================================

1. Use single ('') rather than double ("") quotation marks for Jinja strings
1. In Jinja print statements, surround the variable with spaces inside curly
   braces, for example `{{ foo.bar }}`
1. Use double ("") quotation marks around HTML attributes
1. End files with a newline

CSS Formatting Rules
--------------------

1. Font name's first letter should be capital
2. Add a space after comma
3. Declarations should be sorted alphabetically
4. Use a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that
   begins the declaration block
5. Group together related classes and identities
6. Add a space after colon
7. Remove leading 0s
8. Remove unit specification after 0 values
9. Use three digit Hex notation for colors whereever possible
10. User hyphen `-` instead of underscore `_` in class and identity names

Refer to [Google's HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) for all other formatting rules.
