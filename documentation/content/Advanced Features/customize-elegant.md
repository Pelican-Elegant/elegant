[TOC]

You can change Elegant's look, color palette, font, size, and even labels used
for widgets, sections and plugins.

Elegant is best maintained when you treat it as a separate resource in your
project. Do not edit template files, JavaScript code and style sheets. This
practice will make upgrading Elegant fuss free process.

Instead see the guides in ["Extra Customization" category](categories#extra-customization-ref).
