# Introduction

With more than 4 years in the making, this release started "better late then never", but it turned out to _so **much**_ more than that.

With the [community spark re-ignited][announcement_community], this has become the biggest release since probably 1.0. And as such a very worthy release to carry the 2.0 crown.

# Elegant v 2.0 is finally here!

A lot has happened since the last release of elegant theme and a great effort was also done and new steps for the future have been set as the way forward.

V2 is not only a new set of bytes but also features and probably, the most important step has been evolving elegant into a community effort.

Talha, who created the elegant theme, helped this movement by setting a new home for the repository and the documentation as well as adding some next steps towards evolving the theme faster in the future by removing some dependencies.

A brave set of collaborators have helped shape this future via new issue creation, review of pending pull requests and defining how the community and project should continue.

This has been noticed in the last months activity in the repository, the opened issues, and zapping the old ones not to lose any contribution, either from their original authors or resubmitting them on their behalf.

A lot of things are remain to be done that will allow pelican 4.0 compatibility, removal of legacy code inherited from bootstrap, etc

Don't hesitate to give Elegant a new try, testing the new version or experimenting it at our brand new documentation/demo site at <https://pelican-elegant.github.io>.

And of course let us know if something is not as you would expect or wish so that we can have Elegant become your pelican theme.

Thanks to all our contributors mentioned either at Authors document <https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/blob/master/AUTHORS.md> or at <https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/graphs/contributors>

# Stats

**119 issues** were [closed in the 2.0 release][milestone-2.0] – an impressive number, even if we take into account that many of the bugs were of an organizational nature, as Pelican Elegant has changed the development and governance model (more on that in a [separate post][announcement_community]). Compare that to [1.3 release][milestone-1.3], which consisted of 4 issues, or the total amount of closed issues so far, which amount to 133.
