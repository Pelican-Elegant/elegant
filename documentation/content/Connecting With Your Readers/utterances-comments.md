You can use [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) for comments. You have to set `UTTERANCES_REPO` to the repository Utterances will connect to.

That's it. Elegant will take care of the rest.

You can see a working example of Utterances comments in this article.

## Extra Customization

Besides setting `UTTERANCES_REPO`, you also have control over following variables.

1. `UTTERANCES_THEME`. It's default value is `github-light`. For other valid values refer to [utterances documentation](https://utteranc.es/)
1. `UTTERANCES_LABEL`. It's empty by default. If set, Utterances will it to the issues it will create.

!!!warning

    Emoji are supported in label names.âœ¨ðŸ’¬âœ¨
