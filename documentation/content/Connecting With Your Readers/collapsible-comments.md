Readers use scroll bar to track their progress when reading inside their
browsers. Very often comments take up more space than the actual article. When
comments take up more space, it throws the scroll bar proportion off and reader
cannot judge his progress correctly. Hacker News hosted [a

Elegant keeps the comments section hidden by default. Reader can hide and
unhide the section by clicking on the comments section.

This is how comments section appear

![Collapsed comments

It expands when reader clicks on it
