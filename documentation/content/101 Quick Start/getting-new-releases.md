Unlike a number of themes that exist for Pelican, the Elegant theme is currently under
active development. The immediate benefit of this for you is that Elegant supports
recent technologies/services such as [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) for comments and
the [Applause button](https://applause-button.com/) for quick and simple user feedback.
The other main benefits are that any requests, be they bug reports or feature requests,
are logged in the project's Issues database. These are actively going through triage,
then being worked on by the Elegant community. In addition, there is a roadmap of the
planned work [available here](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/milestones).

To give you the control to decide whether to update your website and benefit from the
latest version of Elegant, we offer two automated ways to find out about new releases.

## Subscribe to the email Newsletter

Each of the article pages on this Elegant documentation website contain a section at
the bottom of the right sidebar titled `Get New Release Alert`. By adding your email
address in the box below and pressing the `Notify Me` button, you are signing up for our
newsletter. This simple newsletter uses Elegant's support for
[MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/), <!-- yaspeller ignore -->
and is only used to notify people when there are new version of Elegant available.

## Subscribe to the RSS feed for the Documentation Site

If you have any reservations about actively subscribing to a newsletter through a
mailing list, you can passively subscribe to receive updates notices for Elegant by
subscribing to the RSS feed for this website. By selecting the RSS Feed icon under
`Stay In Touch`, your browser will handle the information according to any plugins
present.

Most browsers will require you to install a plugin or extension to enable you to read and
subscribe to the RSS feed. Without it, you will see a jumbled mess of text that is the
XML document that is presented to the RSS Feed plugins. Here are some of the plugins
that we recommend for the various browsers:

- Chrome
  - [RSS Subscription Extension (by Google)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-subscription-extensio/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd)
