Elegant supports the popular web tracking service,
[Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/).

[Get your property ID](https://clarity.microsoft.com/projects/), click on your property and either the URL or the script shown for installation will indicate something like `(window, document, "clarity", "script", "54yzatb1en");`

The `54yzatb1en` will be your property id

Set `MS_CLARITY` variable to it in your configuration.

    :::python
    MS_CLARITY = u'54yzatb1en'

This will load the required script for reporting automatically

That's it. Elegant will take care of the rest.
