You can optionally display the host of your website in the footer.

To do so, define a dictionary `HOSTED_ON` in your Pelican configuration. It has two keys,

1. `name`: mandatory. Value type is string
1. `url`: optional. Value type is string

For example,

```python
HOSTED_ON = {"name": "Netlify", "url": "https://www.netlify.com/"}
```

It will appear in the footer as

![Demonstration of HOSTED_ON variable]({static}/images/hosted-on.png)

If `url` is present then Elegant will add link to your host in the footer with `nofollow` attribute. Otherwise Elegant will display the name without any link.
