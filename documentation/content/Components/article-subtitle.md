Pelican lets you define title of your article in the metadata. Elegant adds
subtitle support. Just define `subtitle` in your article's metadata and it
will appear along with your title. Here is an example,

![Article subtitle
example]({static}/images/elegant-theme_article-subtitle.png)

Article subtitle is displayed with the title in every list. To keep it visibly
separate from title, subtitle is enclosed in `<small>` tag. When visible cue
cannot be used, like in the title attribute of HTML anchor tag `<a>`, a hyphen
is inserted between them.
