Elegant is a minimal theme. Instead of creating separate pages for each tag,
Elegant shows all the tags on a single page. To help visitor find the tags he
is interested in, Elegant offers live filter.

Go to tags page and type your required tag in "Find a tag" search box. Elegant
will automatically filter the list.

For example, this is how my tags page looks like

![Tags view unfiltered]({static}/images/elegant-theme_tags-live-filter-default.png)

As soon as I type
"os", <!-- yaspeller ignore -->
all other tags are filtered out

![Tags view filtered for "os"]({static}/images/elegant-theme_tags-live-filter-filtered.png) <!-- yaspeller ignore -->

With live filter, your reader will have no difficulty in picking up his desired
tag from the list, even if your site has hundreds of tags.
