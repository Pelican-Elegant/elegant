Elegant uses commonly available typefaces in every style rule. It has a list of
closely matching fonts in the fallback list.

For examples
Baskerville <!-- yaspeller ignore -->
is the
first choice for headings. But if reader does not have
Baskerville <!-- yaspeller ignore -->
installed,
Garamond <!-- yaspeller ignore -->
will be used. If that too fails then Georgia will be used.
