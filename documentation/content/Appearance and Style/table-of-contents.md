[TOC]

The key concept driving Elegant's design is to provide a reading experience that
is clean with minimal distractions.  From that point of view, providing a table of
contents does not provide any additional information, but only exists to help guide the
reader through the article.  Therefore, Elegant places the table of contents on the left side
of the page with a relatively smaller font.  This enables the table to guide the reader without
grabbing the focus of the reader and distracting them.

## Configuration

Enabling the Elegant' display of the table of contents is a two-part process.  The first
part of the process uses the markup languages to provide table of contents information that
can be displayed.  The second part of the process takes that information and allows it to
be better displayed on the left side of the article.   If both parts are not completed,
the table of contents will not be displayed on the left side of the article.

To enable the second part of this process, you need to enable the `extract_toc` plugin in
your pelican configuration.

```python
PLUGINS = ['extract_toc']
```

Note that this value must be added to any existing values present for the `PLUGINS`
configuration variables.

## Configuring Markdown

To enable the first part of the process for Markdown, you need to enable the `toc` extension
for Markdown.

```python
MARKDOWN = {
  'extension_configs': {
    'markdown.extensions.toc': {}
  }
}
```

Note that this value must be added to any existing values present for the `MARKDOWN` configuration variables.

### Enabling Permalinks

It is strongly recommended that you take advantage of `permalink` option available for the
`toc` extension.  Regardless of this option's setting, clicking on the entries in the table
of contents will take you to the listed sections.  Enabling the `permalink` option will
provide permanent links for each section.  These permanent links can then be used to go
directly to the section they refer to without going through the table of contents.

To enable this option, you need to add the `'permalink': 'true'` property to the
`'markdown.extensions.toc'` section that was added in the previous section.

```python
MARKDOWN = {
  'extension_configs': {
    'markdown.extensions.toc': {
      'permalink': 'true',
    }
  }
}
```

### Other Options

For other options available for the Markdown Table of Contents extension, refer to the
[Python - Markdown - Table of Contents](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/toc/)
page.

### Per Article Usage

To generate a table of contents for you article, add the `[TOC]` markdown tag to your
document.

```Markdown
Title: My sample title
Date: 2014-12-03
Category: Examples

[TOC]

## This is my first heading

This is the content of my sample blog post.

## This my second heading

I will end my example here.
```

### Debugging

If the tag `[TOC]` is not replaced with some form of a table of contents, verify that the
`MARKDOWN` configuration variable is set properly.  If the tag is interpreted but does not
appear on the left side of the article, verify that the `PLUGINS` configuration variable is
set properly.

## Configuring reStructuredText Format

The reStructuredText format has the
[`contents`](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table-of-contents)
directive that generates a table of contents in the article.

### Per Article Usage

To generate a table of contents for you article, add the `.. contents::` tag to your document.

```rest
My sample title
###############

:date: 2014-12-03
:category: Examples

.. contents::

This is my first heading
========================

This is the content of my sample blog post.

This my second heading
======================

I will end my example here.
```

## Hide Default Title Text

!!! note
    Our testing of this issue does not repeat the effects detailed below.  This should be considered deprecated, but is retained in this document in case someone encounters this.

Using the default configuration, reStructuredText will generate a default title for the table
of contents. According to the [official
documentation](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table-of-contents),

> Language-dependent boilerplate text will be used for the title. The English
> default title text is "Contents".

This default configuration creates two titles for your table of contents, one generated by
reStructuredText and the other by Elegant.  To disable default title generation
[^disableTitle], you need to add following rule in your `custom.css` file to hide the
duplicate title:

```css
div#contents p.topic-title.first {
    display: none;
}
```

[^disableTitle]: There is [no straightforward way](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/issues/54) to disable default title generation in reStructuredText.
