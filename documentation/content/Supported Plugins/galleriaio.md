[TOC]

Similar to the use case defined in [Photogallery]({filename}photogallery.md), Pelican uses <https://galleria.io> code to show images from instagram.

## Article Metadata

To enable the plugin, just set a `yaml preamble` entry for instagram like:

```yaml
instagram_id: <picture ID>
```

For reference, the `picture ID` is taken from Instagram picture URL, for example:

`https://www.instagram.com/p/OzF8OwS43q/` will mean adding to the headers:

```yaml
instagram_id: OzF8OwS43q
```

To get it shown on the article.

No other plugin settings must be configured or modified at this time.

!!! hint "instagram_id defines either picture or set of pictures"

    Note that `instagram_id` is the part in the url of a post, that can be a single or multiple pictures 'post' and in both case the library will show them.
