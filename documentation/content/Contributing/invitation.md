Our brand new documentation website [elegant.onCrashReboot.com][elegant-home] is a great demo for the theme.

If you like the theme and would like to contribute to Elegant, you are most welcome to do so. Even though Pelican is written in Python, no coding skills are needed to help out with Elegant, as themes consist mostly of [Jinja][] templates, CSS and HTML. It is honestly very easily to get into.

If you want to help out, but have no idea where to start, we keep a list of [low-priority features that are just waiting for you to pick up][pr_welcome].

Another way to contribute is to help with the [documentation][docs]. We are keeping a list of [good first issues][docs_first] for newbies to get involved â€“ these are easy to tackle, but in no way less helpful.

And, of course, reporting bugs and filing feature requests to further improve Elegant (and its documentation), is also welcome.
