[TOC]

This website, [elegant.onCrashReboot.com](https://elegant.oncrashreboot.com),
is an excellent demonstration of the theme that all of us contributors love. While looking for
new features that add to what Elegant has to offer, we also continue to take great care that
we adhere to [Elegant's Look and Feel]({filename}./why-look-and-feel.md).

This practice allows you, a website owner, the opportunity to give you readers a clean flow of
reading through the body of the article with minimal destructions, with no loss of
functionality. When new features are added, you can decide whether or not to adopt these
features with the confidence that those new features will be consistent with what you already
are using. This will provide the users of your website with something that is well thought out
and organized, appealing to many readers.

To accomplish this, Elegant is proudly a
[team driven open source project]({filename}./community-driven-project.md).
While it was created in 2012 by Talha Mansoor, the change to a community driven project in
early 2019 has energized the development of the project. By asking "how can I help" or
"do you need help with...", people have slowly joined the team and enriched the theme to what
you see today. The contributions of these people has allowed the project to grow beyond the
scope of what any one of them could accomplish on their own. Their contributions, together as
a team, are responsible for the project you see here today.

## What Can I Do?

If using the Elegant theme and reading this invitation inspires you to contribute, we welcome
the addition of your creativity to our team. No coding skills are required to volunteer to
help with Elegant. The theme is mostly composed of templates written in
[Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) utilizing
[metadata]({filename}../Advanced Features/metadata.md) associated with each article. We are
confident that if you want to help, we can get you up and running in no time!

## Where Do I Start?

As you are volunteering your time and energy, we don't want you to take on a really big task
to start, scaring you away in the process. For this purpose, we keep a refined list of
[lower priority issues](https://github.com/pelican-elegant/elegant/labels/pull%20request%20welcome)
to allow you to gently ease yourself into assisting with the project. If none of those
issues appeal to you, feel free to look at all of our
[open issues](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/issues?q=is:open+is:issue), and see
if any of those are more attractive to you.

If none of that appeals to you and you still want to help, don't worry! We know we are not
perfect and rely on feedback from our users to help us make the theme better for everyone.
